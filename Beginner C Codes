Hi! I’m Syed Shayan Rizvi, a Computer Science student at FAST University with a deep interest in programming, problem-solving, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Over the past four years, I’ve built a strong foundation in C and C++, and I’m now expanding my skills in Python to dive deeper into AI and Machine Learning.

I love exploring how code can solve real-world problems and make systems smarter. My goal is to build intelligent technologies and contribute to open-source AI projects that create a meaningful impact.
